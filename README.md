# Grocery-List
This Java program takes a users input for a recipe, and generates a shopping list with the appropriate amounts of ingredients based on the number of people that need to be fed. 
# Overview

This program was used as my own introduction to Java. I learned a lot about the structure and nuances of this language through creating this program.

With this program I explored Java's Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, and Data structures such as HashMap.

# Development Environment

I used Intellij to create and edit this program, I found it very useful for Java-specific problem solving.
